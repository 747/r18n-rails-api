= R18n

R18n is a i18n tool to translate your Ruby application in several languages.

Use <tt>merb_r18n</tt> to localize Merb Web application and 
<tt>r18n-desktop</tt> to localize desktop application.

== Features

* It has special support for countries with two official languages. If there
  isn’t translation in user locale, it will be found in locales, which
  user may know (not only in default locale). For example, many people in 
  Belarus can understand Russian, and locale has information about it.
* It can format numbers and time to the rules of the user locale, translate
  month and week days name and give other locale information.
* It has translation for commons words, like “OK”, “Cancel”, etc.
* It storage translation in rich YAML format. You can put procedures and
  pluralization (“1 comment”, “5 comments”) or create you own filters.
* It can translate Web and desktop applications.

== Usage

=== Translation
Translation files use YAML format and has name like en.yml (English) or
en_US.yml (USA English dialect) with language/country code (RFC 3066).

In translation you can use:
* Strings
    robot: This is robot
    percent: "Percent sign (%)"
* Numbers
    number: 123
    float: 12.45
* Pluralizable messages
    robots: !!pl
      0: No robots
      1: One robot
      n: %1 robots
* Procedures
    sum: !!proc |x, y| x + y
* Filters
    filtered: !!custom_type
      This content will be processed by filter

To get translated string use method with key name or square brackets [] for
keys, which is same with Object methods (+class+, +inspect+, etc):

  i18n.robot    #=> "This is robot"
  i18n["robot"] #=> "This is robot"

Translation may be hierarchical:

  i18n.post.add       #=> "Add post"
  i18n['post']['add'] #=> "Add post"

If locale willn’t be found in user locale R18n will search it in they sublocales
or in another locale, which user know:

  i18n.no.in.english #=> "В английском нет"

Translated string has +locale+ method and you can get it locale (Locale instance
or code string if locale is’t supported in R18n):

  i18n.no.in.english.locale #=> Locale ru (Русский)

You can replace some parameters in translated string by put it as arguments:
  
  name: "My name is %1"

  i18n.name('John') #=> "My name is John"

Pluralizable messages get item count from first argument:

  i18n.robots(0)  #=> "No robots"
  i18n.robots(1)  #=> "One robot"
  i18n.robots(50) #=> "50 robots"

If there isn’t pluralization for some number, translation will be use 'n'. If
there isn’t locale file for translation, it will be use English pluralization
rule (0, 1 and 'n').

R18n already has translation for common words for most supported locales.
See <tt>base/</tt> in dir in gem.

  i18n.yes    #=> "Yes"
  i18n.cancel #=> "Cancel"
  i18n.delete #=> "Delete"

== Filters
You can also add you own filter for translations: escape HTML entries, convert
from Markdown syntax, etc.

  R18n::Filters.add('custom_type', :filter_name) do |content, config, replace|
    content.gsub(' ', replace)
  end
  R18n::Filters.add('custom_type') do |content, config, replace|
    content + '!'
  end
  
  i18n.filtered('_') #=> "This_content_will_be_processed_by_filter!"

You can also add global filters for all translated strings:

  R18n::Filters.add(String, :escape_html) do |content, config|
    escape_html(content)
  end

You can use lambdas in your translations. If it isn’t secure in your application
(for example, user can change translations), you can disable it:

  R18n::Filters.off(:procedure)

R18n contain 2 filters to escape HTML entries: by YAML type and global. If you
need to escape HTML in some translations, just set <tt>!!escape</tt> YAML type:

  greater: !!escape
    1 < 2 is true

If you develop web application and want to escape HTML in all translations, just
activate global escape filter:

  R18n::Filters.on(:global_escape_html)

=== Localization
You can print number and float according to the rules of the user locale:

  i18n.l -12000.5 #=> "−12,000.5"

Number and float formatters will also put real typographic minus and put
non-break thin spaces (for locale, which use it as digit separator).

You can translate months and week days names in Time, Date and DateTime by
+strftime+ method:

  i18n.l Time.now, '%B'  #=> "September"

R18n has some time formats for locales: <tt>:human</tt>, <tt>:full</tt> and
<tt>:standard</tt> (by default):

  i18n.l Time.now, :human #=> "now"
  i18n.l Time.now, :full  #=> "August 9th, 2009 21:47"
  i18n.l Time.now         #=> "08/09/2009 21:41"
  i18n.l Time.now.to_date #=> "08/09/2009"

=== Locale
All supported locales are storage in R18n gem at +locales+ dir. If you want to
add your locale, please write me to andrey@sitnik.ru.

To get information about locale create R18n::Locale instance:

  locale = R18n::Locale.load('en')

You can get from locale:
* Locale title and RFC 3066 code:
  
    locale['title'] #=> "English"
    locale['code'] #=> "en"
  
* Language direction (left to right, or right to left for Arabic and Hebrew):
  
    locale['direction'] #=> "ltr"
  
* Week start day ("sunday" or "monday")
  
    locale['week']['start'] #=> "sunday"

== Add locale
If R18n hasn’t locale file for your language, please add it. It’s very simple:
* Create in locales/ file _code_.yml for your language and describe locale.
  Just copy from another locale and change different values.
  * If your language is dialect or base on another (as American English (en_US) 
    base on English (en)) write <tt>include: _base_locale_</tt> and similar
    values can be deleted.
  * If in your country people mostly know another language (like in exUSSR
    countries people know Russian), write
    <tt>sublocales: [_another_locale_, en]</tt>. Else write only:
    <tt>sublocales: [en]</tt>. For dialect put base locale to +sublocales+ too.
* Create in base/ file _code_.yml for your language and translate base messages.
  Just copy file from language, which you know, and rewrite values.
* If you language need some special logic (for example, different pluralization
  or time formatters) you can change Locale class. Create in locales/ file
  _code_.rb and write R18n::Locales::_Code_ class, which must extend
  R18n::Locale.
* Push files by GitHub (http://github.com/ai/r18n) or just write e-mail with
  this files to me (andrey@sitnik.ru).

_Code_ is RFC 3066 code for your language (for example, “en” for English and
“fr_CA” for Canadian French). You can send to my e-mail any questions (on
http://sitnik.ru you find another contact addresses).
